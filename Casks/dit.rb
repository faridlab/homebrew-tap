  # DIT is not notarized yet (ADR 0029). Homebrew marks every download as
  # quarantined, and macOS refuses to open a quarantined app that Apple has
  # not notarized. The mark is cleared from DIT's own bundle while it is
  # still staged — after the sha256 above was checked, before the bundle is
  # moved to Applications, which copies its attributes as they then are.
  # This goes away with notarization.
